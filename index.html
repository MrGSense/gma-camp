                <h1>About Janet</h1>
                <p>I was appointed to the IRB City Commission in November, 2023 and want to continue to serve the
                    residents of IRB. I have been part of the IRB community since 1996:. First as a vacationer, in 1999 as a
                    vacation condo owner, as snowbirds in 2016, then full-time residents in 2019. My personal and
                    professional experiences have provided me a set of skills I feel make me uniquely suited to the City
                    Commission position. As a school administrator I developed skills in group presentation, grant writing,
                    program development, community partnerships, and addressing legislative bodies. As a citizen-led
                    committee co-chair; I presented to community organizations and city government, wrote editorials, and
                    appeared in media. As a special need parent, I served on state advisory boards charged with program
                    development.</p>
