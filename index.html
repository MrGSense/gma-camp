          <p class="about_text">
            I was appointed to the IRB City Commission in November, 2023 and
            successfully ran to retain the seat during the March, 2024 election.
            I want to continue to serve the residents of IRB therefore I am
            running for reelection this March. I have been part of the IRB
            community since 1996:. First as a vacationer, in 1999 as a vacation
            condo owner, as snowbirds in 2016, then full-time residents in 2019.
            My personal and professional experiences prior to being a
            commissioner provided me a set of skills that I have been able to
            utilize during my time on the dais. As a school administrator I
            developed skills in group presentation, grant writing, program
            development, community partnerships, and addressing legislative
            bodies. As a citizen-led committee co-chair; I presented to
            community organizations and city government, wrote editorials, and
            appeared in media. As a special need parent, I served on state
            advisory boards charged with program development. As a commissioner
            I have used these skills to represent the voice of Indian Rocks
            Beach as the voting representative at Florida League of Cities
            (FLOC) conferences, re-establishing Indian Rocks Beach as member of
            Suncoast League of Cities (SCLOC), and this January I will be
            joining the Advocacy Teams from SCLOC and FLOC in Tallahassee during
            the legislative session.

              It has allowed me to bring new ideas and perspectives to problems

              Conference in 2024 and 2025. I am scheduled to participate in the

              opportunity for me to share how our town will be impacted by
              proposed legislation on various topics. I will be participating in

              After Helene Beth McMullen provided a contact at Red Cross which I
              followed up on. After spending 3 hours going street to street with
              a Red Cross Director on assignment here from Pennsylvania our city
              was given a truckload of supplies for residents. Buckets
              containing cleaning supplies, tarps, rakes, and shovels were
              amongst the supplies. After seeing the devastation here first hand
              the decision was made to move the Operation Center to Tampa Bay

              done. I will also conduct my own research on it utilizing the
