            I was appointed to the IRB City Commission in November, 2023 and
            want to continue to serve the residents of IRB. I have been part of
            the IRB community since 1996: First as a vacationer, in 1999 as a
            vacation condo owner, as snowbirds in 2016, then full-time residents
            in 2019. My personal and professional experiences have provided me a
            set of skills I feel make me uniquely suited to the City Commission
            position. As a school administrator I developed skills in group
            presentation, grant writing, program development, community
            partnerships, and addressing legislative bodies. As a citizen-led
            committee co-chair; I presented to community organizations and city
            government, wrote editorials, and appeared in media. As a special
            need parent, I served on state advisory boards charged with program
            development.
